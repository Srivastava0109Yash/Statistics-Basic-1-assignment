    "In terms of central tendency, outliers can have a strong influence on the mean, pulling it towards the direction of the outlier. This is because the mean is sensitive to extreme values. On the other hand, the median is less affected by outliers because it is simply the middle value of a sorted dataset and is not influenced by extreme values. The mode may also be affected by outliers if the outlier is the most frequently occurring value.\n",
